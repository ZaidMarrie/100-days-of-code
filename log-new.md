# 100 Days Of Code - Log of my second attempt

### Day 01: January 08, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a Dashboard app as part of the Learn Next.js Course. I learned some new things about data fetching in Next. I also got some basic knowledge about databases as I completed this module of the course. After working on the course I spent time learning how to work with forms in React. I used Formik and Yup to handle my forms and form validation.

**Thoughts:** In Next you can query data directly from your database when you are quering data from a server component. This is because it is run on the server it does not expose your database secrets. Working with Formik and Yup to build and validate forms in React is such a breeze. I think it is efficient and quite straightforward.

### Day 02: January 09, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued exploring how to handle forms with Formik. I then used what I had learned to create form components in a side project I am currently working on. I also had some fun with some cool CSS effects.

**Thoughts:** I would like to expand my knowledge with these technologies, but I found that they have to be used in client-side components. I does make sense though, since you are handling user input.

### Day 03: January 10, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the Ethereal Fashion Store to add a new page route. I added the `help-center` page route. This route was then composed of a few components that I broke into smaller pieces to create an accordion. The accordion gets its data from sanity, where I defined a schema for this. The schema only has two fields though, so it was not much work to define and add data for this schema. In addition to adding the `help-center` route, I handled form fields with `Formik` and added validation using `Yup`.

**Thoughts:** Working with Formik over the past few days, I can see how it can save me time when working with forms in `React`. I can't say that I am happy with how it works, but it is relatively simple so that's good. Using `Yup` for validation is much more satisfying than doing it from scratch.

### Day 04: January 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I was planning on working on the side-project I've been working on. I never got around to it, but decided to read some interesting articles on CSS. So no code for today though.

**Thoughts:** I got no thought to share today.

### Day 05: January 12, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I built a privacy policy page. After building the privacy notice page I took some time to unwind by building a fancy navigation. The navigation menu I built is from Kevin Powell's Youtube channel.

**Thoughts:** The privacy policy generated by Termly does not allow you to copy text from the site. It is very frustrating, since I have to type everything out word for word. Aside from this shitty task of building a privacy policy, the navigation built by Kevin is amazing. The `view-transition` API is superb. My mind is blown by just how amazingly smooth the animations are. This API is still experimental though, but I can't wait till it has good browser support. It could be a while before that happens though.

### Day 06: January 13, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Learned about maps/dictionaries from TheTechDevGuide's DSA path. I tried to solve the HackerRank challenge on Maps/Dictionaries. Will try again tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I need some more practice on Maps.

### Day 07: January 15, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Revisited Maps & Hash Tables data structures.

**Thoughts:** I tried to design a Hash Table from the [LeetCode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/182/practical-applications/1139/) I got on [TechDevGuide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/). This was very overwhelming and intimidating for me. I had no idea where to start. The same thing happened when I tried the [Four Sum Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/description/).

### Day 08: January 17, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I got started learning how to add authentication to a Next.js application. I learned how to add API routes and how to protect routes.

**Thoughts:** Adding authentication with NextAuth is awesome. I have been procrastinating and avoiding adding authentication to my ecommerce app, but it has been a walk in the park adding it in tutorial projects.

### Day 09: January 18, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I continued my learning journey on the Next.js learn course and I completed the following chapters:

- Chapter 8: Static and dynamic rendering
- Chapter 9: Streaming
- Chapter 10: Partial prerendering

Streaming and suspense boundaries blew my mindðŸ¤¯.

**Thoughts:** Streaming in Next.js is so awesome. It makes applications look so professional and make the experience of waiting for data to load in so much more satisfying. Partial rendering combines static and dynamic rendering, however, it is not stable yet.

### Day 10: January 19, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I continued with the Next.js course and learned how to add search and pagination to an app using `searchParams` and the Next.js API's.

**Thoughts:** It is very easy and intuitive to create search and pagination within a Next.js application. I have learned valuable things that I look forward to using within my own applications.
