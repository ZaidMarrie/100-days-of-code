# 100 Days Of Code - Log of my second attempt

### Day 01: January 08, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a Dashboard app as part of the Learn Next.js Course. I learned some new things about data fetching in Next. I also got some basic knowledge about databases as I completed this module of the course. After working on the course I spent time learning how to work with forms in React. I used Formik and Yup to handle my forms and form validation.

**Thoughts:** In Next you can query data directly from your database when you are quering data from a server component. This is because it is run on the server it does not expose your database secrets. Working with Formik and Yup to build and validate forms in React is such a breeze. I think it is efficient and quite straightforward.

### Day 02: January 09, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued exploring how to handle forms with Formik. I then used what I had learned to create form components in a side project I am currently working on. I also had some fun with some cool CSS effects.

**Thoughts:** I would like to expand my knowledge with these technologies, but I found that they have to be used in client-side components. I does make sense though, since you are handling user input.

### Day 03: January 10, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the Ethereal Fashion Store to add a new page route. I added the `help-center` page route. This route was then composed of a few components that I broke into smaller pieces to create an accordion. The accordion gets its data from sanity, where I defined a schema for this. The schema only has two fields though, so it was not much work to define and add data for this schema. In addition to adding the `help-center` route, I handled form fields with `Formik` and added validation using `Yup`.

**Thoughts:** Working with Formik over the past few days, I can see how it can save me time when working with forms in `React`. I can't say that I am happy with how it works, but it is relatively simple so that's good. Using `Yup` for validation is much more satisfying than doing it from scratch.

### Day 04: January 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I was planning on working on the side-project I've been working on. I never got around to it, but decided to read some interesting articles on CSS. So no code for today though.

**Thoughts:** I got no thought to share today.

### Day 05: January 12, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I built a privacy policy page. After building the privacy notice page I took some time to unwind by building a fancy navigation. The navigation menu I built is from Kevin Powell's Youtube channel.

**Thoughts:** The privacy policy generated by Termly does not allow you to copy text from the site. It is very frustrating, since I have to type everything out word for word. Aside from this shitty task of building a privacy policy, the navigation built by Kevin is amazing. The `view-transition` API is superb. My mind is blown by just how amazingly smooth the animations are. This API is still experimental though, but I can't wait till it has good browser support. It could be a while before that happens though.

### Day 06: January 13, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Learned about maps/dictionaries from TheTechDevGuide's DSA path. I tried to solve the HackerRank challenge on Maps/Dictionaries. Will try again tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I need some more practice on Maps.

### Day 07: January 15, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Revisited Maps & Hash Tables data structures.

**Thoughts:** I tried to design a Hash Table from the [LeetCode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/182/practical-applications/1139/) I got on [TechDevGuide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/). This was very overwhelming and intimidating for me. I had no idea where to start. The same thing happened when I tried the [Four Sum Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/description/).

### Day 08: January 17, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I got started learning how to add authentication to a Next.js application. I learned how to add API routes and how to protect routes.

**Thoughts:** Adding authentication with NextAuth is awesome. I have been procrastinating and avoiding adding authentication to my ecommerce app, but it has been a walk in the park adding it in tutorial projects.

### Day 09: January 18, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I continued my learning journey on the Next.js learn course and I completed the following chapters:

- Chapter 8: Static and dynamic rendering
- Chapter 9: Streaming
- Chapter 10: Partial prerendering

Streaming and suspense boundaries blew my mindðŸ¤¯.

**Thoughts:** Streaming in Next.js is so awesome. It makes applications look so professional and make the experience of waiting for data to load in so much more satisfying. Partial rendering combines static and dynamic rendering, however, it is not stable yet.

### Day 10: January 19, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I continued with the Next.js course and learned how to add search and pagination to an app using `searchParams` and the Next.js API's.

**Thoughts:** It is very easy and intuitive to create search and pagination within a Next.js application. I have learned valuable things that I look forward to using within my own applications.

### Day 11: January 20, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on the invoicing app I have been building from the Next.js course. The chapter I covered was on "Mutating data with server actions". In this chapter, I used server actions to mutate data in forms. I learned how to work with the native FormData object and how to make optimistic updates.

**Thoughts:** I found these methods for mutating data to be very powerful. I can truly see how this can be helpful to me. From what I can tell, working with server actions is more secure than how I have been doing things. With this in mind, server actions are a progressive enhancement. They work with the native FormData object to gather data from form fields. They can do this even when JavaScript fails to load or is disabled. As a result users will still be able to interact with your apps, making it a greater UX & DX experience.

### Day 12: January 21, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to gracefully handle errors with JavaScript's try/catch blocks. I also learned about the error.tsx file in Next.js and how it can be used as a catch-all error route. Lastly, I use the notFound() function, and the not-found.tsx file to handle routes that don't exist.

**Thoughts:** Handle errors in Next.js is a seamless process. You can catch-all errors with a simple file like `error.tsx`. This makes the process of handling errors while still keeping your application working much easier. The user can still use the application even when an error occurs. You can also use the `notFound()` function from `next/navigation` to redirect a user to a 404 not found page. The 404 error page can be created with a `not-found.tsx` file. It is important to not that the `not-found` file takes precedence over the `error` file.

### Day 13: January 22, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I complete chapter 14 & 15 of the Next.js Learn course. I learned how to improve form accessibility using server-actions, a few new ARIA-\* attributes, and the useFormState hook. I also added authentication using NextAuth and the Next.js middleware.

**Thoughts:** Adding authentication the way I did in this course is completely different from the approaches I came across in Youtube videos and some articles. I do think that this approach is more appropriate and a better way to implement authentication. I do however, want to learn how to add authentication with JWTs to create not only login functionality but also signup functionality.

### Day 14: January 23, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I just completed the @nextjs learn course. I built the dashboard app and I was able to get a better understanding of certain concepts & features in Next.js. This was an awesome way of learning, as I only had to focus on what I needed to in each chapter. Going forward I would like to practice what I learned to build better React apps.

**Thoughts:** This course was an amazing experience building this fullstack dashboard app. I am inspired to build an application that I can use to track invoices, proposals, clients, project, and so much more. This could be a very useful app that I could use in my day-to-day freelance business as a creative developer. Adding a project like this to my portfolio would be amazing. Recruiters and hiring manager like to see these types of projects. Projects like this show how you can use your skills to build something that you use to solve a real problem.
