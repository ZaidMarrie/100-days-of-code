# 100 Days Of Code - Log of my second attempt

### Day 01: January 08, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a Dashboard app as part of the Learn Next.js Course. I learned some new things about data fetching in Next. I also got some basic knowledge about databases as I completed this module of the course. After working on the course I spent time learning how to work with forms in React. I used Formik and Yup to handle my forms and form validation.

**Thoughts:** In Next you can query data directly from your database when you are quering data from a server component. This is because it is run on the server it does not expose your database secrets. Working with Formik and Yup to build and validate forms in React is such a breeze. I think it is efficient and quite straightforward.

### Day 02: January 09, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued exploring how to handle forms with Formik. I then used what I had learned to create form components in a side project I am currently working on. I also had some fun with some cool CSS effects.

**Thoughts:** I would like to expand my knowledge with these technologies, but I found that they have to be used in client-side components. I does make sense though, since you are handling user input.
