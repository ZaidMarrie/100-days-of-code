# 100 Days Of Code - Log of my second attempt

### Day 01: January 08, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a Dashboard app as part of the Learn Next.js Course. I learned some new things about data fetching in Next. I also got some basic knowledge about databases as I completed this module of the course. After working on the course I spent time learning how to work with forms in React. I used Formik and Yup to handle my forms and form validation.

**Thoughts:** In Next you can query data directly from your database when you are quering data from a server component. This is because it is run on the server it does not expose your database secrets. Working with Formik and Yup to build and validate forms in React is such a breeze. I think it is efficient and quite straightforward.

### Day 02: January 09, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued exploring how to handle forms with Formik. I then used what I had learned to create form components in a side project I am currently working on. I also had some fun with some cool CSS effects.

**Thoughts:** I would like to expand my knowledge with these technologies, but I found that they have to be used in client-side components. I does make sense though, since you are handling user input.

### Day 03: January 10, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the Ethereal Fashion Store to add a new page route. I added the `help-center` page route. This route was then composed of a few components that I broke into smaller pieces to create an accordion. The accordion gets its data from sanity, where I defined a schema for this. The schema only has two fields though, so it was not much work to define and add data for this schema. In addition to adding the `help-center` route, I handled form fields with `Formik` and added validation using `Yup`.

**Thoughts:** Working with Formik over the past few days, I can see how it can save me time when working with forms in `React`. I can't say that I am happy with how it works, but it is relatively simple so that's good. Using `Yup` for validation is much more satisfying than doing it from scratch.

### Day 04: January 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Today I was planning on working on the side-project I've been working on. I never got around to it, but decided to read some interesting articles on CSS. So no code for today though.

**Thoughts:** I got no thought to share today.
