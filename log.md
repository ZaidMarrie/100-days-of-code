# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 03, 2013

**Today's Progress:** Today I started learning about Python's Dictionaries. I learned the following:

- How to define a dictionary.
- How to access and work with values stored in a dictionary.
- How to loop through all the information in a dictionary.
- How to nest lists in dictionaries and vice versa, and also nest dictionaries in other dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** I have found that dictionaries allow you to model real life data more accurately, they allow you to connect one piece of information with another and I think that they are more flexible for storing complex data types.
