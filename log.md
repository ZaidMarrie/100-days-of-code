# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started learning about Python's Dictionaries. I learned the following:

- How to define a dictionary.
- How to access and work with values stored in a dictionary.
- How to loop through all the information in a dictionary.
- How to nest lists in dictionaries and vice versa, and also nest dictionaries in other dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** I have found that dictionaries allow you to model real life data more accurately, they allow you to connect one piece of information with another and I think that they are more flexible for storing complex data types.

### Day 2: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent a few hours learning and experimenting with the Python's `input()` function and while loops.

**Thoughts:** The `input()` function can be very helpful for creating programs that are interactive, and also's allow your programs to work with data provided by a user. I also found that you can use a while loop to keep a program running as long as a user wants it to; or until a certain condition is reached.

### Day 3: June 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned how to define function and use functions in Python, I learned quite a lot about functions such as:

- How to define functions and pass data to them.
- How to use positional and keyword arguments.
- How to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.
- How to use store functions as seperated files, called _modules_.
- I also learned some common conventions and practices associated with styling functions

**Thoughts:** I find that the ability to pass an arbitrary keyword arguments very interesting. It could be very useful when gathering data, if you do not know how much data will be needed. Combined with the dictionary data type this can make building complex programs much easier.

### Day 4: June 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about Python's classes, how to define them, store information(attributes), defined methods within a class, instantiation, how to modify attributes directly and through methods, and I also learned about inheritance. I also learned about Python's Standard library.

**Thoughts:** The concept of inheritance can simplify the creation of related objects, it can make your code easier to read and understand.

### Day 5: June 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent time working with files. I learned how to read files, how to write/append to files, how to handle _Exceptions_, how to use the `json` module to store and load data.

**Thoughts:** Unlike vanilla _JavaScript_, Python offers a way to manipulate files out of the box and `json` is much easier to use.

### Day 6: June 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I wrote my first unit test in Python using the `unittest` module. I wrote tests for both functions and classes, and created multiple test cases to verify different behaviors.

**Thoughts:** Testing your code allows you to catch bugs and errors before a user of your program encounters them. When testing your code you can be more confident that adding new features implemented into your project won't break the parts that work.

### Day 7: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to install and use the `pygame` module, how to draw a screen which is a surface for your game to run on, how to draw images to that screen and how to handle events.

**Thoughts:** The `pygame` module is very useful if you are planning to build a game. It has many features that help make building a game much more easy.

### Day 8: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to use the `Sprite` and `Group` classes from the `pygame` module. I used these classes to manipulate a group of objects.

**Thoughts:** The `Sprite` and `Group` classes provides you with a simple and efficient way to manage a games objects, as long as you know how to use it.

### Day 9: June 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I implemented a scoring system in the alien invasion game I have been working on. Whilst doing so I learned how to add text to the screen which has to be drawn as an image using the `pygame.font` module.

**Thoughts:** I am quite suprised that Python does not have a built-in method for display text. However, I find the `pygame` module to b very powerful.

### Day 10: June 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started using and learning how to use the `matplotlib` module. I used it to create visualizations of certain data sets.

**Thoughts:** The `matplotlib` can be used in many ways. It can be used to analyze large amounts of data very quickly. You can also represent the data in visualizations in many forms which include scatter plot, line graphs, etc.

### Day 11: June 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I worked with real-world datasets. These data sets were stored as CSV and JSON files. I parsed these files into data which I can more easily use within Python. I then used the data to create meaningful visualizations of weather and earthquake data. I also used `Plotly` to create a visualization of geagraphical data on a world map.

**Thoughts:** Using the CSV and JSON data formats you can analyze and process any data you want.

### Day 12: June 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I installed the `requests` module using _pip_. I then used this module to make an API call to the _gihub_ API, stored and processed the information that was returned and created a visualization of the _Most-Starred_ Python Projects on Github.

**Thoughts:** APIs make it easy to create self-contained programs that works with up to date information/data that is returned from an API call, even if the data is rapidly changing.

### Day 13: June 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I have covered alot as I started learning the _Django_ framework. I learned the following:

- How to setup and start a virtual environment.
- How to install _Django_ to a virtual environment.
- How to setup and app, and define models to represent data for the app.
- How to migrate a database after making changes to models.
- How to create a _superuser_ for an admin site.
- How to define URLs, create views, and write templates to make pages for a site.
- How to use template inheritance, and template tags.

**Thoughts:** Creating templates using template inheritance can simplify the structure of individual templates and makes it easy to modify a site as it evolves. It also prevents from you having to repeat the same code.

### Day 14: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I built a simple user authentication and registration system, which allows users to log in/out; register if they don't have an account, and restricted access to certain pages, only accessible by logged in users.

**Thoughts:** Using the default _Django_ functions to validate user input is very easier as it automates the process so you don't have to worry much about the security of your app.
