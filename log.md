# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: August 03, 2013 

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a responsive navigation menu with an animated hamburger.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun with animations and coding the javascript for it. At first I did not understand what the code does but eventually figured it out.

### Day 4: August 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I just played Flexbox Froggy, to practice the flexbox layout properties @playCodepip
. Check it out!

**Thoughts**: I learned some new flexbox properties and they are: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis.

### Day 5: August 05, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp about objects.

**Thoughts**: Got stuck at some point but I figured it out after an hour on my own just before giving up. Glad I continued to the end
