# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started learning about Python's Dictionaries. I learned the following:

- How to define a dictionary.
- How to access and work with values stored in a dictionary.
- How to loop through all the information in a dictionary.
- How to nest lists in dictionaries and vice versa, and also nest dictionaries in other dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** I have found that dictionaries allow you to model real life data more accurately, they allow you to connect one piece of information with another and I think that they are more flexible for storing complex data types.

### Day 2: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent a few hours learning and experimenting with the Python's `input()` function and while loops.

**Thoughts:** The `input()` function can be very helpful for creating programs that are interactive, and also's allow your programs to work with data provided by a user. I also found that you can use a while loop to keep a program running as long as a user wants it to; or until a certain condition is reached.
