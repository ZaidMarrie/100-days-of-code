# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started learning about Python's Dictionaries. I learned the following:

- How to define a dictionary.
- How to access and work with values stored in a dictionary.
- How to loop through all the information in a dictionary.
- How to nest lists in dictionaries and vice versa, and also nest dictionaries in other dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** I have found that dictionaries allow you to model real life data more accurately, they allow you to connect one piece of information with another and I think that they are more flexible for storing complex data types.

### Day 2: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent a few hours learning and experimenting with the Python's `input()` function and while loops.

**Thoughts:** The `input()` function can be very helpful for creating programs that are interactive, and also's allow your programs to work with data provided by a user. I also found that you can use a while loop to keep a program running as long as a user wants it to; or until a certain condition is reached.

### Day 3: June 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned how to define function and use functions in Python, I learned quite a lot about functions such as:

- How to define functions and pass data to them.
- How to use positional and keyword arguments.
- How to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.
- How to use store functions as seperated files, called _modules_.
- I also learned some common conventions and practices associated with styling functions

**Thoughts:** I find that the ability to pass an arbitrary keyword arguments very interesting. It could be very useful when gathering data, if you do not know how much data will be needed. Combined with the dictionary data type this can make building complex programs much easier.

### Day 4: June 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about Python's classes, how to define them, store information(attributes), defined methods within a class, instantiation, how to modify attributes directly and through methods, and I also learned about inheritance. I also learned about Python's Standard library.

**Thoughts:** The concept of inheritance can simplify the creation of related objects, it can make your code easier to read and understand.

**Link to work:** [Classes exercises](https://github.com/ZaidMarrie/python_crash_course/blob/main/exercises/chapter_9.py)

### Day 5: June 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent time working with files. I learned how to read files, how to write/append to files, how to handle _Exceptions_, how to use the `json` module to store and load data.

**Thoughts:** Unlike vanilla _JavaScript_, Python offers a way to manipulate files out of the box and `json` is much easier to use.

**Link to work:** [Files and Exceptions exercises](https://github.com/ZaidMarrie/python_crash_course/blob/main/exercises/chapter_10.py)

### Day 6: June 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I wrote my first unit test in Python using the `unittest` module. I wrote tests for both functions and classes, and created multiple test cases to verify different behaviors.

**Thoughts:** Testing your code allows you to catch bugs and errors before a user of your program encounters them. When testing your code you can be more confident that adding new features implemented into your project won't break the parts that work.

### Day 7: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to install and use the `pygame` module, how to draw a screen which is a surface for your game to run on, how to draw images to that screen and how to handle events.

**Thoughts:** The `pygame` module is very useful if you are planning to build a game. It has many features that help make building a game much more easy.

### Day 8: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to use the `Sprite` and `Group` classes from the `pygame` module. I used these classes to manipulate a group of objects.

**Thoughts:** The `Sprite` and `Group` classes provides you with a simple and efficient way to manage a games objects, as long as you know how to use it.

**Link to work:** [Project 1 Source Code](https://github.com/ZaidMarrie/python_crash_course/tree/main/projects/alien_invasion_game)

### Day 9: June 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I implemented a scoring system in the alien invasion game I have been working on. Whilst doing so I learned how to add text to the screen which has to be drawn as an image using the `pygame.font` module.

**Thoughts:** I am quite suprised that Python does not have a built-in method for display text. However, I find the `pygame` module to b very powerful.

### Day 10: June 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started using and learning how to use the `matplotlib` module. I used it to create visualizations of certain data sets.

**Thoughts:** The `matplotlib` can be used in many ways. It can be used to analyze large amounts of data very quickly. You can also represent the data in visualizations in many forms which include scatter plot, line graphs, etc.

**Link to work:** [Project 2 Source Code](https://github.com/ZaidMarrie/python_crash_course/tree/main/projects/data_visualization)

### Day 11: June 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I worked with real-world datasets. These data sets were stored as CSV and JSON files. I parsed these files into data which I can more easily use within Python. I then used the data to create meaningful visualizations of weather and earthquake data. I also used `Plotly` to create a visualization of geagraphical data on a world map.

**Thoughts:** Using the CSV and JSON data formats you can analyze and process any data you want.

### Day 12: June 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I installed the `requests` module using _pip_. I then used this module to make an API call to the _gihub_ API, stored and processed the information that was returned and created a visualization of the _Most-Starred_ Python Projects on Github.

**Thoughts:** APIs make it easy to create self-contained programs that works with up to date information/data that is returned from an API call, even if the data is rapidly changing.

### Day 13: June 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I have covered alot as I started learning the _Django_ framework. I learned the following:

- How to setup and start a virtual environment.
- How to install _Django_ to a virtual environment.
- How to setup and app, and define models to represent data for the app.
- How to migrate a database after making changes to models.
- How to create a _superuser_ for an admin site.
- How to define URLs, create views, and write templates to make pages for a site.
- How to use template inheritance, and template tags.

**Thoughts:** Creating templates using template inheritance can simplify the structure of individual templates and makes it easy to modify a site as it evolves. It also prevents from you having to repeat the same code.

### Day 14: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I built a simple user authentication and registration system, which allows users to log in/out; register if they don't have an account, and restricted access to certain pages, only accessible by logged in users.

**Thoughts:** Using the default _Django_ functions to validate user input is very easier as it automates the process so you don't have to worry much about the security of your app.

### Day 15: June 30, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I styled the learning-log app I've been working on using the _Bootstrap_ library and the django-bootstrap4 app. I also deployed my app to heroku using the heroku-cli.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap provides you with simple to use templates for creating various web components that speed up the styling process of web apps.

### Day 16: July 04, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I revised what I have learnt about HTML. I revised the basics of HTML which include: how to structure an HTML document, metadata in HTML(The Head), HTML text fundamentals, creating hyperlinks, advanced text formatting, and how to debug an HTML document.

**Thoughts:** There are elements that I was not aware of that I could have used in the past, such as `<blockquote>`, `<q>`, `<cite>`, and `<dl>`. These elements also has semantic meaning which could help add proper meaning to certain text and format it correctly, resulting in better accessibility (i.e. especially for people using screen reader).

**Link to work:** [A simple page of content](https://codepen.io/LeKoels27/pen/OJvyNBw)

### Day 17: July 06, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I learned more about multimedia and embedding elements such as `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, and `<embed>`. Additionally, I was introduced to some security concerns regarding embedding content using `<iframe>`s, known CSP(Content Security Policy).

**Thoughts:** Embedding different media types can make the web experience more inclusive as it allows multiple mediums for consuming content, such as text, video, audio(among others).

### Day 18: July 07, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I took a look at _HTML_ tables. I marked-up tabular data and used a little _CSS_ for basic styling.

**Thoughts:** _HTML_ tables make it easy to display tables of information, such as timetables, plans, and/or statistics.

**Link to work:** [Tabular Planet Data](https://codepen.io/LeKoels27/pen/QWmyoyY)

### Day 19: July 08, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Had a look at what _CSS_ is, how it is structured, and how it works. I also styled a basic _HTML_ page with some simple _CSS_ declarations, which are key-value pairs(a property and a property value). The values in each declaration specify how that value should style the property.

**Thoughts:** There are many different ways to apply styling to an element, such as `type-selectors`, `class-selectors`, `id-selectors`, `combinators` and much more. These are called _selectors_ and they are used to target elements on a page.

**Link to work:** [Biography Page](https://codepen.io/LeKoels27/pen/BarKRXY)

### Day 20: July 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took a deeper dive into specificity, the cascade, inheritance, and selectors(mostly combinators). I learned some interesting things about the inheritance values, such as `inherit`, `unset`, `revert`, and `initial`.

**Thoughts:** The inheritance values can be used as a value for any property, which is often referred to as global values.

**Link to work:** [MDN - Cascade & Inheritance Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance)

### Day 21: July 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** For today I had a look at different writing modes in CSS. I learned about logical properties and values, which allow you to add styles based on the writing mode specified. Alongside writing modes, I also had a look at styling images, media & form elements.

**Thoughts:** I previously faced problems sizing images when using layout properties such as `flexbox` & `grid`. The problem I faced was the behaviour that images had, which were not the same as other elements. I usually avoid making images direct children of a `flex` or `grid` container to prevent this behaviour. Until now I have not understood this behaviour. This is actually the default behaviour which prevents images from being stretched, as `grid` & `flex` items stretch by default.

### Day 22: July 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Read about organising & authoring your CSS. I learned about some common _CSS_ methodologies for writing structured _CSS_, which in turn results in reuseable, readable, and cleaner code. I prefer the _BEM_ naming conventions.

**Thoughts:** Writing structured _CSS_ can help make maintaining large _CSS_ projects much easier as they are more structured and readable. They allow you to easily understand a project even after returning to the project years later.

### Day 23: July 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Had a look at some of the most common text/font _CSS_ styling properties as well as some lesser known properties such as font-variant, font-variant-ligatures, font-kerning, writing-mode, etc.

**Thoughts:** _CSS_ provides us(developer) with very efficient and effective text and font styling methods to create custom font styling, similar to what rich-text formatting software(MS Office Suite) allows you to do.

### Day 24: July 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Got introduced to _CSS_ layout, by looking at the normal flow of an _HTML_ document. In addition to the normal flow of a document, I covered more layout methods such as `flexbox`, `grid`, `float`s, and `position`ing.

**Thoughts:** _CSS_ provides us with very interesting tools to create both one-dimensional and two-dimensional layouts. They can be used to create very complex layouts with minimal code and styling, which is very efficient.

**Link to work:** No work to share today

### Day 25: July 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about responsive web design(RWD). I explored the media queries at-rule that _CSS_ provides, using a mobile-first approach. I also looked at some legacy layout methods that were used before `flexbox` and `grid`.

**Thoughts:** Responsive web design allows us as developers to design our sites to be useable across a variety of screen sizes, since we have a diverse range of devices with varying screen sizes in modern times. This approach of laying out our webpages allows for a better web experience, regardless of the device you are using.

### Day 26: July 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started learning _JavaScript_. I learned what it is and what it's used for. In addition to that I learned about some of the basics such as variables, the `number` data-type, the `string` data-type, and some common methods available to these data-types.

**Thoughts:** _JavaScript_ is a very useful and powerful language. It is dynamically typed, meaning that you do not have to specify a varibles type when initialized. It is also a interpreted language, which means it does not have to be converted to an understandable format. It is compiled at runtime, unlike other languages that are compiled before runtime(These are considered compiled languages). Another concept that I learned was that variables declared with `var` are hoisted. This concept can be seen as having all varibles declared at the top since it can be used before being declared.

### Day 27: July 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took some time to play around with _Array's_ and some of the most common _Array_ methods in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** _Arrays_ allow for storing multiple values in a single variable. You can use a loop to do the same thing to every element in an _Array_ with very minimal code.

**Link to work:** [Silly Story Generator](https://codepen.io/LeKoels27/pen/qBorVgw)

### Day 28: July 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Read some articles on _loops_, _conditional_, _functions_, and _events_ in JavaScript. In the process I learned about the event bubbling, capturing, and target phases; I now understand these event phases, as I never understood them before.

**Thoughts:** The `Event` object that is passes to the event-handler function, provides us with some properties and methods that can help with configuring how the event is handled. I also discovered the `Event.currentTarget` property, which is like a reference to the _Node_ the event is attached to; I have been looking for this for quite some time.

### Day 29: July 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Went over _Object-Oriented Programming_ concepts. I also played around with some `class`es, inheritance, and the prototype chain.

**Thoughts:** _Object-Oriented Programming_ allows you to create templates for the properties and methods(functions), you want a object to have. This method of defining objects makes for a more efficient way to create objects that contain the same properties and methods, as you only define it in one place and create instances of the class(which is the object template you create). These instances then share the same properties and methods, however, the values may differ.

### Day 30: July 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about synchronous programming and why we need asynchronous programming. After learning about the differences between synchrounous and async I learned about `Promise`s and `async await`.

**Thoughts:** Asynchrounous programming has a much cleaner and easier to read syntax than the traditionally used methods which included nested callbacks (often referred to as "callback hell"); They are difficult to read and debug.

### Day 31: July 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I took some time to have a look at the _Document Object Model_ and some of the methods and features I haven't used before. In addition to the DOM, I also had an interesting read on the `Fetch()` API.

**Thoughts:** The `Fetch()` API is a modern version of the `XMLHttpRequest` API. The DOM(Document Object Model) is used to manipulate the HTML document and Styles associated with that document, allowing for interactive and dynamic web pages.

### Day 32: July 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Had an introduction to drawing graphics on the web. I got started learning about the `<canvas>` element and the associated _Canvas API_. I also learned a few things about loops and animations as well as some basics about `WebGL`. Here are some articles about these topics:

- [Drawing Graphics | MDN Article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Drawing_graphics)
- [Getting Started with WebGL | MDN Article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Getting_started_with_WebGL)

**Thoughts:** The _Canvas_ and _OpenGL_ API's provide developers to perform powerful 2D & 3D rendering in an _HTML_ `<canvas>`.

### Day 33: July 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I explored some of the properties and methods of the `HTMLMediaElement` API, to control audio and video players.

**Thoughts:** Not all browsers have the same controls when the `controls` attribute is added to `<audio>` or `<video>`. This is results in inconsistent cross-browser support and it would be better to implement controls using _JavaScript_.

**Link to work:** [Video & Audio APIs | MDN Article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Video_and_audio_APIs)

### Day 34: August 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I learned about _Client-side Storage_. The `Web Storage API` stores simple data such as strings and numbers, and the `IndexedDB API` stores more complex data.

**Thoughts:** The Client-side storage APIs that are provided to us developers are super usefull and powerful, as they allow us to create web sites/apps that can be loaded offline which can improve the overall experience for a user. This makes each subsequent load of a web page/app faster as it does not load assets twice.

### Day 35: August 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed the [Learn JavaScript For Free Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) on _Scrimba_. I also completed the three solo projects from the course. ["Basketball Scoreboard", "Password Generator", "Unit Converter"]

### Day 36: August 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started learning _React_.

**Thoughts:** React is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

**Link to work:** [React Tutorial - Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

### Day 37: August 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I built the Task Tracker App from Brad Traversy's [React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) on Youtube.

**Thoughts:** Building apps in React is more robust and it allows for dynamic markup. It allows you to create reusable components.
