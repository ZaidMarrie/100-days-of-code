# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I started learning about Python's Dictionaries. I learned the following:

- How to define a dictionary.
- How to access and work with values stored in a dictionary.
- How to loop through all the information in a dictionary.
- How to nest lists in dictionaries and vice versa, and also nest dictionaries in other dictionaries.

**Thoughts:** I have found that dictionaries allow you to model real life data more accurately, they allow you to connect one piece of information with another and I think that they are more flexible for storing complex data types.

### Day 2: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent a few hours learning and experimenting with the Python's `input()` function and while loops.

**Thoughts:** The `input()` function can be very helpful for creating programs that are interactive, and also's allow your programs to work with data provided by a user. I also found that you can use a while loop to keep a program running as long as a user wants it to; or until a certain condition is reached.

### Day 3: June 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned how to define function and use functions in Python, I learned quite a lot about functions such as:

- How to define functions and pass data to them.
- How to use positional and keyword arguments.
- How to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.
- How to use store functions as seperated files, called _modules_.
- I also learned some common conventions and practices associated with styling functions

**Thoughts:** I find that the ability to pass an arbitrary keyword arguments very interesting. It could be very useful when gathering data, if you do not know how much data will be needed. Combined with the dictionary data type this can make building complex programs much easier.

### Day 4: June 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about Python's classes, how to define them, store information(attributes), defined methods within a class, instantiation, how to modify attributes directly and through methods, and I also learned about inheritance. I also learned about Python's Standard library.

**Thoughts:** The concept of inheritance can simplify the creation of related objects, it can make your code easier to read and understand.

### Day 5: June 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent time working with files. I learned how to read files, how to write/append to files, how to handle _Exceptions_, how to use the `json` module to store and load data.

**Thoughts:** Unlike vanilla _JavaScript_, Python offers a way to manipulate files out of the box and `json` is much easier to use.
